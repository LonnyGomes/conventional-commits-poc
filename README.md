# Conventional Commits POC

Testing conventional commits tooling

-   [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration) - useful for a CI-driven workflow
-   [standard version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) - manages releases at a local level
